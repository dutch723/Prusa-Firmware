# 3.5.1 firmware, 7x7 mesh bed leveling, and heatbed 'preheat error' bug fix

### TL;DR: 

This firmware is completely stock except for addition of the 7x7 mesh bed leveling and changes to temperature files to fix the heatbed 'preheat error' bug that arose in 3.5.1.  Still requires g-code changes for 7x7 mesh bed leveling, recommend running a PID tune on the heatbed afterwards as well.  

There is a version for MK3, MK2.5 (RAMBo 1.0 and 1.3 please use the right one for your PCB).  MK2S is not applicable. All sources linked below.

### Long version:  

After upgrading to 3.5.1 with (or without) mesh bed leveling a lot of users have been encountering preheat errors when heating the heatbed above 90C.  This occurred either before printing (heating stage) or while printing when the bed temperature was increased after the first layer.  I encountered this while trying to heat the bed to 140C (modified firmware - not included in the attached versions) even after two successful PID tunes at 140C.

Prusa changed some settings within the temperature files (temperature.h and temperature.cpp) of the firmware from 3.4.1/3.4.2 to 3.5.0/3.5.1.  You can read more about the 'preheat error' bug here:  https://bit.ly/2FuFFQr  I simply reverted the heatbed (only) PID and preheat error settings to how they were in the 3.4.1 version in the temperature.h and temperature.cpp files. 

This firmware also includes the 7x7 mesh bed leveling as posted by Chris Warkocki (see his post here: https://bit.ly/2DdJRlr), which was originally developed by github users stahlfabrik and mionut.  Github link: https://bit.ly/2SXsTNE . This version probes each point 3 times, I prefer this one for redundancy purposes in case a bad measurement was taken (unlikely).  I won't be making a 1 probe point per version, so if the extra 5 seconds per point is bothersome please don't use these versions. 

I was unable to secure a beta tester for MK3 so please have a firmware .hex for backup in case something doesn't work properly.  MK2.5 (RAMBo 1.3) was tested by myself and Fedor Pikus is currently testing it as he ran into the 'preheat error' bug on 3.5.1. 

Happy printing!

# Build
## Linux
Run shell script build.sh to build for MK3 and flash with Sli3er.  
If you have different printel model, follow step [2.b](#2b) from Windows build first.  
If you wish to flash from Arduino, follow step [2.c](#2c) from Windows build first.  

The script downloads Arduino with our modifications and Rambo board support installed, unpacks it into folder PF-build-env-\<version\> on the same level, as your Prusa-Firmware folder is located, builds firmware for MK3 using that Arduino in Prusa-Firmware-build folder on the same level as Prusa-Firmware, runs secondary language support scripts. Firmware with secondary language support is generated in lang subfolder. Use firmware.hex for MK3 variant. Use firmware_\<lang\>.hex for other printers. Don't forget to follow step [2.b](#2b) first for non-MK3 printers.
## Windows
### 1. Development environment preparation

   a. install `"Arduino Software IDE"` for your preferred operating system  
`https://www.arduino.cc -> Software->Downloads`  
it is recommended to use version `"1.8.5"`, as it is used on out build server to produce official builds.  
_note: in the case of persistent compilation problems, check the version of the currently used C/C++ compiler (GCC) - should be `4.8.1`; version can be verified by entering the command  
`avr-gcc --version`  
if you are not sure where the file is placed (depends on how `"Arduino Software IDE"` was installed), you can use the search feature within the file system_  
_note: name collision for `"LiquidCrystal"` library known from previous versions is now obsolete (so there is no need to delete or rename original file/-s)_

   b. add (`UltiMachine`) `RAMBo` board into the list of Arduino target boards  
`File->Preferences->Settings`  
into text field `"Additional Boards Manager URLs"`  
type location  
`"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultimachine/ArduinoAddons/master/package_ultimachine_index.json"`  
or you can 'manually' modify the item  
`"boardsmanager.additional.urls=....."`  
at the file `"preferences.txt"` (this parameter allows you to write a comma-separated list of addresses)  
_note: you can find location of this file on your disk by following way:  
`File->Preferences->Settings`  (`"More preferences can be edited in file ..."`)_  
than do it  
`Tools->Board->BoardsManager`  
from viewed list select an item `"RAMBo"` (will probably be labeled as `"RepRap Arduino-compatible Mother Board (RAMBo) by UltiMachine"`  
_note: select this item for any variant of board used in printers `'Prusa i3 MKx'`, that is for `RAMBo-mini x.y` and `EINSy x.y` to_  
'clicking' the item will display the installation button; select choice `"1.0.1"` from the list(last known version as of the date of issue of this document)  
_(after installation, the item is labeled as `"INSTALLED"` and can then be used for target board selection)_  

   c. modify platform.txt to enable float printf support:  
add "-Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt -lm" to "compiler.c.elf.flags=" before existing flag "-Wl,--gc-sections"  
example:  
`"compiler.c.elf.flags=-w -Os -Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt -lm -Wl,--gc-sections"`

### 2. Source code compilation

a. place the source codes corresponding to your printer model obtained from the repository into the selected directory on your disk  
`https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/`  

b.<a name="2b"></a> In the subdirectory `"Firmware/variants/"` select the configuration file (`.h`) corresponding to your printer model, make copy named `"Configuration_prusa.h"` (or make simple renaming) and copy it into `"Firmware/"` directory.  

c.<a name="2c"></a> In file `"Firmware/config.h"` set LANG_MODE to 0.

run `"Arduino IDE"`; select the file `"Firmware.ino"` from the subdirectory `"Firmware/"` at the location, where you placed the source codes  
`File->Open`  
make the desired code customizations; **all changes are on your own risk!**  

select the target board `"RAMBo"`  
`Tools->Board->RAMBo`  
_note: it is not possible to use any of the variants `"Arduino Mega â€¦"`, even though it is the same MCU_  

run the compilation  
`Sketch->Verify/Compile`  

upload the result code into the connected printer  
`Sketch->Upload`  

or you can also save the output code to the file (in so called `HEX`-format) `"Firmware.ino.rambo.hex"`:  
`Sketch->ExportCompiledBinary`  
and then upload it to the printer using the program `"FirmwareUpdater"`  
_note: this file is created in the directory `"Firmware/"`_  

# 3. Automated tests
## Prerequisites
c++11 compiler e.g. g++ 6.3.1

cmake
